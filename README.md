# ResponsivePortfolio
A professional portfolio highlighting my development skills and proficiency.

For this project I created a responsive portfolio website that displays attractively across any size of device.
I built this website with bootstrap and utilized the following features.

Bootstrap's row/column system
Media queries
CSS positioning

This project is a work in progress and will continue to be updated as I finish other work.
